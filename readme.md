The aim of drug classification is to make sure you use a drug safely and get the greatest possible benefit. Every time you take a drug, your body chemistry changes.

No single classification system can meet all of these needs; however, there should be consistency among those that group by the same underlying principals. We discovered discrepancies in how drugs with multiple therapeutic indications are classified among four widely used schemas.
